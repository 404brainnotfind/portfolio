# Welcome to Hui Miao's Portfolio

I am a Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba with a minor in Economics. My academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical skills and programming capabilities, which I've successfully applied in real-world business settings.

With experience in supply chain coordination and a passion for data analysis, I bridge the gap between technical expertise and practical business solutions. I enjoy tackling complex problems and transforming data into actionable insights that drive decision-making.

My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Java, and various data visualization techniques. I'm particularly interested in opportunities where I can apply my data analysis skills to optimize business processes and create value.
